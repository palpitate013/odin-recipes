        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li> 
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li> 
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li> 
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and sliced</li> 
        <li>2 celery stalks, sliced</li> 
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li> 
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li> 
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream or half-and-half</li> 
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li> 
    </ul>
    <h5>Crust:</h5> 
    <ul> 
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li> 
        <li>1/4 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li> 
        <li>1/4 cup ice-cold water</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3> 
    <h5>Step 1: Make the Filling</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li> 
        <li>In a large skillet or sauté pan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat.</li> 
        <li>Add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and set aside.</li> 
        <li>In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of butter.</li> 
        <li>Once melted, add the diced onion, minced garlic, sliced carrots, and celery stalks.</li> 
        <li>Cook until the vegetables are tender, about 8-10 minutes.</li> 
        <li>Add the flour to the skillet and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.</li> 
        <li>Gradually stir in the chicken broth and heavy cream or half-and-half.</li> 
        <li>Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for 2-3 minutes, until thickened slightly.</li> 
        <li>Stir in the cooked chicken and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Step 2: Make the Crust</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li> 
        <li>Add the cold butter pieces and use a pastry blender or your fingers to work them into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li> 
        <li>Gradually add the ice-cold water, stirring with a fork until the dough comes together in a ball.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Step 3: Assemble the Pie</h5> 
    <ol>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out half of the crust dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch (3 mm).</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Pour the chicken filling over the dough in the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Roll out the remaining crust dough to the same size as before and place it on top of the filling.</li>
        <li>Crimp the edges of the pie crust to seal the filling inside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Step 4: Bake the Pie</h5> 
    <ol>
        <li>Brush the top of the pie with a little bit of milk or beaten egg for a golden glaze.</li>
        <li>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the filling is hot and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Step 5: Serve</h5> 
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade chicken pot pie!</li>
    </ol>
