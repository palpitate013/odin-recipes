# HTML Recipes Project

## Objective
The primary goal of this project was to learn and practice the basics of HTML. Through this project, I created simple web pages to showcase three different recipes: Grilled Cheese, Hamburgers, and Chicken Pot Pie. Each page demonstrates fundamental HTML elements and structure.

---

## Features
- **Main Recipes Page**:  
  A home page with links to individual recipe pages.
- **Individual Recipe Pages**:  
  Detailed pages for each recipe, including:
  - Title and headings
  - Description of the dish
  - Ingredients list
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Image of the dish for visual appeal

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Core language for building the structure of the web pages.

---

## Lessons Learned
- Using semantic HTML tags like `<h1>`, `<h3>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<p>`, and `<a>` for proper structure.
- Adding images with the `<img>` tag and customizing their size with attributes like `height` and `width`.
- Linking between pages using the `<a>` tag.
- Structuring content with lists (`<ul>` and `<ol>`) and organizing information logically.

## How to View
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
3. Click on the links to navigate to individual recipe pages.

## Future Improvements
- Add CSS to enhance the design and layout of the pages.
- Incorporate JavaScript for interactivity, such as form validation or a recipe rating feature.
- Create a responsive design to improve usability on mobile devices.
